Only thing I would change about our own code is maybe adding and implementing a separate interface
for our editor view instead of just adding extra private methods. I think this would make the
design much more flexible and easier to add on to like the editor view provided for us. Our
experience with our providers was a positive one. We got our provider code in a timely manner.
Everything was well-explained and documented. They were great about answering any questions we had
and gave very detailed answers that were helpful.
